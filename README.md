# TABLEAU
VBA examples for Tableau
This contains a fully functioning primary routine that 
executes login, obtains token and SID, 
then calls for a function to do a data query against view defined, 
then calls for sub routine that parses response and writes it to a table.
I have not seen may examples of data queries against Tableau I hope this helps someone else.
If anyone has a better way to obtain the response that is maybe easier to parse, I would love o hear it.. this uses XML and response comes as string that must be parsed.
